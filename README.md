# Freelancer-Hub
Freelancer Hub is a full-stack Java Swing desktop application inspired by Upwork and Freelancer.com. It enables clients to post jobs, freelancers to apply, and both parties to manage proposals, contracts, messaging, and payments, with data stored in a connected MySQL relational database.
